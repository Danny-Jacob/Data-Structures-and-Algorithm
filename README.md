# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm

This repository is for tracking my daily practice of solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. I am practicing various problems from different categories, such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.

## Directory Structure
- **Arrays/**: Problems related to array manipulation and algorithms.
- **LinkedLists/**: Problems related to linked lists.
- **Trees/**: Binary Trees, BST, etc.
- **Graphs/**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.
- **DynamicProgramming/**: Problems on dynamic programming like knapsack, LCS, etc.

## How to Use
- Check out the different directories based on the category you're interested in.
- Each file contains a solution to a specific problem.

## Goal
The goal is to solve at least one problem per day and improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
